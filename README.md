# ManuallyOrderable

Adds freebie functions for manually ordering elements in SwiftData.

## Motivation

SwiftData (by default) uses [CoreData](https://youtu.be/qRKdH7Sxt2g) under the hood. This means that arrays do not (by default) preserve ordering.

This library adds a manually tracked `index` property and reordering functions to access elements in a predicable order, and reorder thier contents as necessary.
